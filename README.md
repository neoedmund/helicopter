An EFI bootloader customized from rEFInd 





- Only for AMD64(x86_64) PC
- Only for Windows and Linux and EFI
- 0 Config, all auto-detect.


working in process
- [TODO] build original refind.efi using mybuildc
- customize ...


project status: pending (for ever) ...
- I'v written a demo to show ttf fonts in EFI in textfrog
- for real life usage, I changed to mastering(by tool written in textfrog) the grub config file instead of customized EFI bootloader
